# Project-2

## Description

LifeLog was created to practice combining the skills covered thus far in boot camp to create a practical and convenient way to schedule your life. The motivation behind this project was simple: create an app that can do everything that existing schedule apps can't do already. We wanted to build something that would eliminate the need for multiple schedule tracking and note-taking apps. LifeLog allows users to create To Do lists within to do lists, view a calendar, and see how much of their day is taken up by each to do item all in one place. 

Our team continued learning throughout the building of LifeLog. An important lesson we learned was the importance of understanding what the MVP functionalities and appearance includes, so as to all be on the same page. We also found that communication was of greater significance than we initially anticipated: Git pulls and merging PRs can sometimes depend on clear communication. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

If you use LifeLog via Heroku, there is no installation required. 

If you download files from the GitHub repository, you will have to run "npm i" in your terminal and log into MySQL to run "source schema.sql." Once you've run schema and quit MySQL, you need to seed the data by running the command "node seeds/seed.js" which will allow you to begin using LifeLog. 

Happy logging!

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
