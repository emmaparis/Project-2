# Project-2

## Description

LifeLog was created to practice combining the skills covered thus far in boot camp to create a practical and convenient way to schedule your life. The motivation behind this project was simple: create an app that can do everything that existing schedule apps can't do already. We wanted to build something that would eliminate the need for multiple schedule tracking and note-taking apps. LifeLog allows users to create To Do lists within to do lists, view a calendar, and see how much of their day is taken up by each to do item all in one place. 

Our team continued learning throughout the building of LifeLog. An important lesson we learned was the importance of understanding what the MVP functionalities and appearance includes, so as to all be on the same page. We also found that communication was of greater significance than we initially anticipated: Git pulls and merging PRs can sometimes depend on clear communication.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
